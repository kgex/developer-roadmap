PixelRNN is a generative model for images that was introduced in 2016 by van den Oord et al. The model uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate images pixel-by-pixel, by predicting the conditional distribution of each pixel given its previous context.
PixelRNN consists of two main parts: the first is the modeling of the joint distribution of the image pixels, and the second is the factorization of the joint distribution into a product of conditional distributions, one for each pixel.
To model the joint distribution, PixelRNN uses a type of RNN called a "gated recurrent unit" (GRU), which takes as input the previously generated pixels and produces a hidden state that is used to predict the distribution of the next pixel.
To factorize the joint distribution into a product of conditionals, PixelRNN uses a technique called autoregression, which means that the prediction of each pixel depends only on its previous context. This is achieved by modeling the conditional distribution of each pixel as a function of its own previous values and the previous values of all pixels in the image.
PixelRNN has been shown to generate high-quality images, and has been used for a variety of applications, including image synthesis, image completion, and image denoising.
