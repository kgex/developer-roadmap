# ***CONTINUOUS CONTROL WITH DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING***

## DDPG reinforcement learning:
***
The deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is a model-free, online, off-policy reinforcement learning method. A DDPG agent is an actor-critic reinforcement learning agent that searches for an optimal policy that maximizes the expected cumulative long-term reward.
