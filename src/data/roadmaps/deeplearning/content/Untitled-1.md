# **DYANAMIC PROGRAMMING**
## **What is Dyanamic Programming ?**
Dynamic programming is a technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the results of each subproblem to avoid redundant calculations.The method is commonly used in areas such as computer science, engineering, mathematics, and economics.

## **Steps involved in Dynamic Programming:**
- Define the problem and identify subproblems
- Formulate the recursive relation
- Implement the algorithm
- Analyze the time and space complexity
