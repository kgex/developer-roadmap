# **XLM-RoBERTa (Cross-lingual Language Model - RoBERTa)**

## **What is XLM-RoBERTa ?**

XLM-RoBERTa (Cross-lingual Language Model - RoBERTa) is a pre-trained language model developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) that can understand and generate text in multiple languages. It is based on the RoBERTa architecture, which is a variant of the popular BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model.


## **Architecture**
The XLM-RoBERTa architecture consists of multiple layers of transformers, which are neural network modules that process input data in parallel. These transformers are bidirectional, meaning they can access both the previous and future tokens in a sequence, allowing the model to understand the context of each word or phrase.
