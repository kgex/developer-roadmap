# Variance

The variance is mean squared difference between each data point and the centre of the distribution measured by the mean.

  # Formula
    S^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}
 S^2	=	sample variance
 x_i	=	the value of the one observation
 \bar{x}	=	the mean value of all observations
 n	=	the number of observations

# Expectation

Mathematical expectation, also known as the expected value, is the summation or integration of a possible values from a random variable. It is also known as the product of the probability of an event occurring, denoted P(x), and the value corresponding with the actual observed occurrence of the event.

  # Formula
     E ( X ) = μ = ∑ x P ( x )
