LINEAR REGRESSION:

	*LINEAR REGRESSION is a supervised learning algorithm in machine learning that is used to establish a mutual
relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the data. 
The goal of linear regression is to predict the value of the dependent variable (also called the response variable) based
on the values of the independent variables (also called predictor variables or features).

	*In a SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL, there is only one independent variable, and the linear equation takes the form 
y = mx + b, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, m is the slope of the line, and b is the 
intercept.The objective is to find the values of m and b that best fit the data points.

	*In a MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL, there are multiple independent variables, and the linear equation takes the 
form y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bnxn, where y is the dependent variable, x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables,
and b0, b1, b2, ..., bn are the coefficients that need to be determined.

				

EXAMPLE:
	Suppose you want to predict the price of a house based on its square footage.
You have a dataset of past house sales that includes the square footage and sale price of each house.

*Your goal is to create a linear regression model that can predict the sale price of a house based on its square footage*
