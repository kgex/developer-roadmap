# LINEAR REGRESSION:

- **LINEAR REGRESSION is a supervised learning algorithm in machine learning that is used to establish a mutual
relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the data. 
The goal of linear regression is to predict the value of the dependent variable (also called the response variable) based
on the values of the independent variables (also called predictor variables or features)**.

- *In a SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL, there is only one independent variable, and the linear equation takes the form 
y = mx + b*.

- *In a MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL, there are multiple independent variables, and the linear equation takes the 
form y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bnxn*.
