# what is ada booster

AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak learners (classifiers or regressors) to create a strong learner.

# why we use ada booster

"Adabooster" is not a commonly used term in machine learning or data science. It may be a misspelling of "Adaboost," which is an adaptive boosting algorithm used for binary classification problems.
