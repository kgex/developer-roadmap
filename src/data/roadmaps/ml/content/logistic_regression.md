# What is logistic regression?


  Logistic regression is a statistical technique used for predicting the probability of a binary or categorical outcome. It is a type of regression analysis where the dependent variable is a binary or categorical variable and the independent variables can be continuous, categorical, or a mix of both.

- The goal of logistic regression is to estimate the probability of the occurrence of an event, based on a set of predictor variables or features. The predicted probability ranges between 0 and 1, and is calculated using a logistic or sigmoid function.

Logistic regression has a wide range of applications in various fields, including marketing, finance, healthcare, and social sciences. It is a popular technique because it is easy to implement, provides interpretable results, and can handle both categorical and continuous independent variables.
