# **FEATURE EXTRACTION**
## ***FEATURE EXTRACTION MAKES MACHINE LEARNING MORE EFFICIENT***

Feature extraction improves the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning. Here are four ways feature extraction enables machine learning models to better serve their intended purpose:  

**Reduces redundant data**:

Feature extraction cuts through the noise, removing redundant and unnecessary data. This frees machine learning programs to focus on the most relevant data. 

**Improves model accuracy**:

The most accurate machine learning models are those developed using only the data required to train the model to its intended business use. Including peripheral data negatively impacts the model’s accuracy.

**Boosts speed of learning**:

Including training data that doesn’t directly contribute to solving the business problem bogs down the learning process. Models trained on highly relevant data learn more quickly and make more accurate predictions. 

**More-efficient use of compute resources**:

Pruning out peripheral data boosts speed and efficiency. With less data to sift through, compute resources aren’t dedicated to processing tasks that aren’t generating additional value.
## ***Feature extraction techniques***
The following is a list of some common feature extraction techniques used by the Machine Learning community:

Principle Components Analysis (PCA)

Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)

t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
