# What is Reinforcement Learning?
Reinforcement Learning is a feedback-based Machine learning technique in which an agent learns to behave in an environment by performing the actions and seeing the results of actions. For each good action, the agent gets positive feedback, and for each bad action, the agent gets negative feedback or penalty.

# How Reinforcement Learning Works
The training mechanism behind reinforcement learning reflects many real-world scenarios. Consider, for example, pet training through positive reinforcement...<a href = "https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/reinforcement-learning.html">Learn more</a><p>
