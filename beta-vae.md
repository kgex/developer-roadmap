# Beta-vae
Beta-VAE is a type of variational autoencoder that seeks to discovered disentangled latent factors. It modifies VAEs with an adjustable hyperparameter 
 that balances latent channel capacity and independence constraints with reconstruction accuracy. The idea is to maximize the probability of generating the real data while keeping the distance between the real and estimated distributions small, under a threshold 
. We can use the Kuhn-Tucker conditions to write this as a single equation:
